# ICEBERG Projects ❄️

Welcome to **ICEBERG Projects**!

This repository is a personal learning space for experimenting with **Apache Iceberg** and related data engineering concepts. It contains a mix of **complete**, **in-progress**, and **experimental** projects as I learn and explore Iceberg.

## 📌 Purpose

- Learn and practice **Apache Iceberg**
- Experiment with different data architectures and tools
- Track progress over time
- Keep both finished and unfinished projects in one place

Some projects may be incomplete or missing components — that’s intentional.

## 🚧 Project Status

Each project may fall into one of the following categories:

- ✅ **Complete** – Functional and documented
- 🚧 **In Progress** – Actively being worked on
- 🧪 **Experimental** – Proof-of-concept or learning experiments
- ❌ **Incomplete** – Paused or abandoned but kept for reference

Check individual project folders for details.

## 🧠 Topics Covered (Planned & Ongoing)

- Apache Iceberg fundamentals
- Table formats and metadata
- Schema evolution
- Partitioning strategies
- Time travel & snapshots
- Integration with tools like:
  - Spark
  - Hive
  - Trino / Presto
  - Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository reflects a **learning journey**. Code may be:
- Unoptimized
- Incorrect
- Incomplete

Use at your own discretion.
